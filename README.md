# Particle_Filter

Particle filter in python based on the book ![Kalman and Bayesian Filters in Python](https://github.com/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python) by ![Roger Labbe](https://github.com/rlabbe).
This code need some cleanup, but was a testing step for the ![Cuttlefish tracker](https://github.com/gabriel-combe/Cuttlefish_Tracker).

## Installation

Only python is needed, with numpy, scipy, and matplotlib libraries.

## Usage example

Run the main.py file in the terminal to start the particle filter.
```sh
python Wordl.py
```

To change the particle structure, the resampling methods, or the example used, comment and uncomment the corresponding part in the code.

> Need an argument parser and some cleanup
